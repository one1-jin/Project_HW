## Grammar Correction Rule
- When the user asks questions in English with grammatical mistakes, automatically correct them.

  - Sentence structure
  - Verb tenses
  - Articles (a, an, the)
  - Prepositions
  - Word choice and natural phrasing

## Correction Format
When providing corrections:
1. Show the corrected version of the user's question/statement
